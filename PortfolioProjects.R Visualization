## Data Description

- When petrol is pumped into tanks, hydrocarbons escape. To evaluate the effectiveness of pollution controls, experiments were performed. The quantity of hydrocarbons escaping was measured as a function of the **tank temperature**, the **temperature of the petrol pumped in**, the **initial pressure in the tank**, and the **pressure of the petrol pumped in**.
- There are 32 observations, one response variable and four predictors. These variables include:
  - $y=$ AmountEscapingHydrocarbons (Response Variable)
  - $x_1=$ TankTemperature (Predictor)
  - $x_2=$ PetrolTemperature (Predictor)
  - $x_3=$ InitialTankPressure (Predictor)
  - $x_4=$ PetrolPressure (Predictor)


## Read data into R

```{r echo = TRUE}

PetrolData1 <- read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sylvadon5/data-files/main/hydro_carbons.csv", header = TRUE, stringsAsFactors = TRUE)

library(tidyverse)

PetrolData <- dplyr::filter(PetrolData1)

summary(PetrolData)

```

### Estimate a multiple linear regression model with `AmountEscapingHydrocarbons` as the response variable and the rest as `Predictor Variables`. Name the estimated model `MLModel_I` in R.

```{r echo = TRUE}

MLModel_I <- lm(AmountEscapingHydrocarbons ~ TankTemperature + PetrolTemperature + InitialTankPressure + PetrolPressure, data = PetrolData)

summary(MLModel_I)

```

###  Use the plot of `residuals` against `fitted values. 

- _The plots appear to have no pattern. The observations have been scattered in the plot below. This indicates that there is no linear relationship between the response and the predictor variables_

```{r echo = TRUE}

plot(FV, RE, xlab = "Fitted Values", ylab = "Residuals", pch = 19, col = "purple")

abline(h=0, col = "darkred")

grid()

```

### Use the plot of `residuals` against `fitted values`. 

- _The red line is roughly horizontal across the plot_ \newline 
_Therefore, the assumption of homoscedasticity is satisfied for the model. That is, the spread of the residuals is roughly equal at all fitted values. Also there seem to be no clear pattern among the residuals. In other words, the residuals should be randomly scattered around the red line with roughly equal variability at all fitted values_

```{r echo = TRUE}

plot(MLModel_I, 1)

grid()

```


###  _An observation with a standardized residual that is larger than 3 (in absolute value) is deemed to be an outlier_ \newline
_From the plot there is no observation with standardized residual that is larger than 3(no observation above the darkred line). Thus, we can conclude that there is no outlier_


```{r echo = TRUE}

plot(abs(SD), xlab = "Observation", ylab = "Standardized Residuals", 
     ylim = c(0, 4), pch = 19, col = "purple")

abline(h = 3, col = "darkred", lwd = 5)

grid()

```


###  _An observation with a studentized residual that is larger than 3 (in absolute value) is deemed to be an outlier_ \newline
_From the plot there is no observation with standardized residual that is larger than 3 (no observation above the darkred line). Thus, we can conclude that there is no outlier_

```{r echo = TRUE}

plot(abs(ST), xlab = "Observation", ylab = "Studentized Residuals", 
     ylim = c(0, 4), pch = 19, col = "purple")

abline(h = 3, col = "darkred", lwd = 5)

grid()

```

### Check for the presence of high leverage point.

- **(Guide)** An observation with a leverage > $\frac{\left(3\times\text{Number of Predictors}+2\right)}{\text{Number of Observations}}$ is classified a high leverage point.

- _The threshold is 0.4375 (darkred line) and all observation on and above the darkred line are regarded to be high leverage points. From the plot there is one high leverage point. That is observation number 18_

```{r echo = TRUE}

plot(LV, xlab = "Observation", ylab = "Leverage", pch = 19, col = "purple")

k <- 4

threshold <- ((3*k)+2)/nrow(PetrolData)

PetrolData[LV > threshold, ]

threshold

abline(h = threshold, col = "darkred", lwd = 5)

grid()

```

### Check for the presence of influential point.

- **(Guide)** An observation with a cook's distance > $\frac{3}{\text{Number of Observations}}$ is classified an influential point.

- _The threshold is 0.09375 (darkgreen line) and all observation on and above the darkgreen are regarded to be influencial points. From the plot there are 4 influencial points. Those are observation numbers 15, 18, 23 and 26_

```{r echo = TRUE}

plot(CD, xlab = "Observation", ylab = "Cook's Distance", pch = 19, col = "purple")

threshold <- 3/nrow(PetrolData)

PetrolData[CD > threshold, ]

threshold

abline(h = threshold, col = "darkgreen", lwd = 5)

grid()

```
